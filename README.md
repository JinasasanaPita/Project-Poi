# Project-Poi
Project Poi is an academic group project for a module focusing on agile software principles. However, we really wanted to try to make something cool out of this project, rather than doing a regular fullstack project. Since none of the members are really keen on doing a fullstack project, we decided to make a game with Unity and try to make something cool with this.

This project is a base building idle game simulator that allows players to build a village fromt the ground up by spawning villagers and placing buildings. There will be upgrades housed in each building as well. The art for this game is extremely limited in terms of assets and budget, but we are trying our best to make the art look as consistent as possible.
